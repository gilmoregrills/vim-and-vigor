# vim_and_vigor
Keeping vim (and now more) settings in sync/backed up.

zshrc works uses spaceship for the prompt and stuff, but requires the char.zsh file here which is a drop-in replacement for the standard spaceship one [here](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt/blob/master/sections/char.zsh)
i could have forked it but im lazy! it gives you a diff random-ish emoji depending on the exit code of your last cmd :)

also lots of the aliases and functions and stuff are incredibly specific to me

font used everywhere is [dank mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono)

The `.vimrc` works with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and neovim

the colorscheme used in the iterm json thingy and my vimrc is based on a colorscheme named fairyfloss: https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/
which is available in most editors!!
